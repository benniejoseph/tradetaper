# TradeTaper Design System

This directory contains the core components of the TradeTaper design system. The goal of this system is to create a consistent, high-quality, and user-friendly experience for all TradeTaper users.

## Guiding Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness.**
- **Consistency is key.**
- **Data should be beautiful and easy to understand.**
- **Empower the user, don't overwhelm them.**

## Structure

The design system is organized into the following subdirectories:

- `core`: Core elements of the design system, such as colors, typography, and spacing.
- `components`: Reusable React components that are used throughout the application.
- `layouts`: Layout components that define the overall structure of the application.

## Usage

To use a component from the design system, simply import it from the appropriate subdirectory. For example:

```
import { Button } from '@/components/design-system/components/Button';
```
