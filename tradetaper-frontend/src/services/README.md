# `tradetaper-frontend/src/services`

This directory contains services for interacting with APIs.

## Directory-Specific Instructions

- Each service should correspond to a specific API or resource.
- Services should handle data fetching, caching, and error handling.

## Local Conventions

- Use a consistent method for making API requests (e.g., Axios).

## Relevant Patterns

- Services are used to abstract away the details of API communication.

## @imports to Shared Documentation

- @import [Src README](../README.md)
