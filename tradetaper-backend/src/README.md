# `tradetaper-backend/src`

This directory contains the core source code for the TradeTaper backend application.

## Directory-Specific Instructions

- All new modules should be created in their own subdirectory.
- Each module should have a `module.ts`, `controller.ts`, `service.ts`, and `entity.ts` file where applicable.

## Local Conventions

- Follow the NestJS framework conventions.
- Use `class-validator` and `class-transformer` for DTOs.

## Relevant Patterns

- Modules are used to organize the application.
- Services contain business logic.
- Controllers handle incoming requests.
- Entities define database models.
